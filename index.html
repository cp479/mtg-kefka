            <p id="primer">This deck brings theatrical cruelty to the table. At its core lies the Villainous Choice mechanic—forcing opponents into lose-lose decisions where every option furthers your agenda. 
                Like the battle menus of a Final Fantasy boss fight, each card presents a forked path: one leading to their suffering, the other to your gain. 
                You don’t just play spells—you offer ultimatums. Surrounding this mechanic is a swirl of chaotic effects: spells that reshuffle resources, force discards, or wheels to redraw entire hands, ensuring no plan survives contact with Kefka. 
                The deck thrives in disorder, twisting each turn into a performance of misdirection and instability. It's less about building value and more about orchestrating the collapse of your enemies through control, misdirection, and spectacular finishers.
                You may not always control the exact outcome—but you always control the terms. And in this deck, your opponents almost always have a choice in their own demise. 
            </p>

            <p id="primer">The blue-black-red Grixis combination is the most individualistic color combo. It showcases the desire for knowledge and self‑perfection, self‑interest and amorality, and for freedom and individuality.  
                Grixis is the shard of power through knowledge, unprincipled ambition, and impulsive destruction. It abandons growth and community, embracing a world where only selfish pursuit and mastery matter.
            </p>
<p>
                                <p id="primer">The focus of the deck is the front-face ability to force opponents to discard while refueling your own hand to win by attrition. If you ever transform Kefka to the backside, 
                then something has gone completely wrong for your opponents (and completely right for you) to be able to transform to the backside.</p>
                </p>

                <p id="primer">Kefka isn't here to play fair—he's here to put on a show, and your suffering is the spotlight.
                </p>
